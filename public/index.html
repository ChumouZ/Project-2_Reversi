    <h3>Rules of Reversiï¼š</h3>
    <p>1. Every game starts with four discs placed in the center of the board.The players choose who goes first.</p>
    <p>2. The incorported piece must outflank one or more of the opponent placed pieces.</p>
    <p>3. To outflank means that a single piece or one straight row (vertical, horizontal or diagonal) of pieces of the
      opponent is in both sides next to own pieces, with no empty squares between all those pieces. The player who makes
      the move turns the outflanked pieces over, becoming all of them in own pieces.</p>
    <p>4. The game is over when neither player has a legal move (i.e. a move that captures at least one opposing piece)
      or when the board is full.</p>
